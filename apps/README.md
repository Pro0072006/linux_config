# Apps

## Firefox

This is in my opinion one of the best web browser, it came by default on linux, depending on your preferences, you can install snap or deb package

- Snap: <https://snapcraft.io/firefox>
- Deb: Execute -> [Script](./brave.sh) `./firefox.bash`

## Git-client

Here is my favourite: [Gittyup](https://murmele.github.io/Gittyup/)
